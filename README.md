# A Multi label A\* (MLA\*) algorithm for Multi-agent Path Finding
- This repository is a python implementation of [this ICAPS-2019 paper](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/vanhoeve/papers/MAPD_ICAPS_2019.pdf).
- This is done collaboratively with Aneesh Dandime as part of the course ENPM661 at UMD.

## Usage:
- To run just MLA* algorithm `python3 mla_star.py`
- It'll generate paths for initial & goal locations defined [here](https://github.com/sparsh-b/mla_star/blob/2a3e0509147414fade42253ec4b00391b5a8d8bd/mla_star.py#L186) and [here](https://github.com/sparsh-b/mla_star/blob/2a3e0509147414fade42253ec4b00391b5a8d8bd/mla_star.py#L187)
